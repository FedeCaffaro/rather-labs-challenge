## Built With

- Hardhat 2.15.0
- Typescript 4.9.5
- Ethers 5.7.2

<!-- INSTALLATION -->

## Usage

To run this app on your pc, you need to:

- clone this repo:

  - Clone with SSH:

  ```
   git@github.com:FedeCaffaro/rather-labs-challenge.git
  ```

  - Clone with HTTPS

  ```
    https://github.com/FedeCaffaro/rather-labs-challenge.git
  ```

- run npm in order to install all the packages

  - `$ npm install`

- then, create a .env file following the .env.example. You will need to add your alchemy key , which you can get at https://www.alchemy.com/. If you want to output a gas report on each transaction and contract deployment you will need a coinmarketcap api key which you can get at https://coinmarketcap.com/api/ .

- This contract interacts with already deployed Sushiswap / Uniswap contract on ethereum mainnet. To replicate this you will need to run a node on the hardhat network forking ethereum mainnet, where ALCHEMY_API_KEY is the ethereum mainnet alchemy key.

  - `$ npx hardhat node --fork https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/<ALCHEMY_API_KEY>`

- on a separate terminal, run the unit tests that replicate a full user flow to join liquidity program.
  - `npx hardhat test --network localhost `
